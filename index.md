# Open Agriculture Foundation
Welcome to the OpenAgriculture Foundation. Here you will find information about the various software
and hardware solutions that were created by OpenAg.

## [Data Sets](datasets.md)
Over time, OpenAg created datasets through operation of various devices. Some of these datasets are preserved on GitHub, 
and you can read about them [here](datasets.md).

## [Personal Food Computer resources](latest_pfc.md)
The latest version of the PFC edu (v4.0) is what is represented in various OpenAg GitHub repositories. You'll find 
detailed information about the hardware and software repositories on the [Personal Food Computer resources](latest_pfc.md) page.
This would be the place to start if you wanted to build the v4.0 latest version of the PFC. It is also a great resource 
to learn about the software that was used, as well as the backend systems that were in place. There is even a link to a
repository on how to host your own version of the backend without needing [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/). One
other bit of information that could be useful is some information on how OpenAg managed a fleet 
of PFCs by using [Balena.io](https://www.balena.io/). 

## [Archived Wiki](archived_wiki/index.md)
The content from the original [OpenAg Wiki can be found as static pages](archived_wiki/index.md). The original wiki files have been converted to 
static markdown and included on this site for archival purposes. This was a semi-automatic conversion from a snapshot 
of the wiki from April 8th, 2020. If there is content you can't find please file an issue, or a pull request 
on [this project](https://github.com/OpenAgricultureFoundation/OpenAgricultureFoundation.github.io). At the time of 
the snapshot, the latest version of the PFC had not be documented, so the wiki only includes up to the 
[v3.0 PFC-EDU](archived_wiki/pfc_edu_3.0.md)

## OpenAg Forum
The OpenAg Forum, which contained much of the community conversation around the OpenAg project was a 
[Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) hosted site. After the foundation shutdown, we had to shut down the forum due to 
the reoccurring cost of running it. A backup was made of the site, and can be made available to someone willing to take 
over the responsibility and cost of hosting and running the forum. Create a GitHub issue on 
[the repository for this page](https://github.com/OpenAgricultureFoundation/OpenAgricultureFoundation.github.io) to start
that conversation.
